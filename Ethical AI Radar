Ethical AI Radar — Pre-Launch Scanner for Bias, Fairness & Compliance in ML Models

Summary:
As AI systems increasingly impact real-world decisions, ensuring that machine learning models are fair, unbiased, and transparent is no 
longer optional — it’s essential. **Ethical AI Radar** is a pre-deployment framework that automatically checks models for bias, fairness, 
explainability, and regulatory compliance.

The system generates a risk report with actionable insights, helping teams address ethical gaps before models go live. This approach promotes 
trustworthy AI practices, reduces reputational risk, and supports responsible innovation across industries.
