Title: AI Watchdog — A Framework for ML Model Drift Detection & Risk Monitoring

Summary:
As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in production across financial systems, ensuring their long-term performance and fairness becomes critical. 
Often, these models silently degrade over time due to data drift, concept drift, or hidden bias — leading to inaccurate predictions and potential business risk.

This idea proposes AI Watchdog, an internal framework that continuously monitors ML models for shifts in data distribution, missing values, performance drops, 
and potential biases. It tracks metrics like feature drift, prediction confidence intervals, and real-world outcome alignment. The framework automatically triggers 
alerts to model owners when anomalies are detected, ensuring timely intervention.

AI Watchdog strengthens BoA’s ML governance practices by proactively identifying model risk, enabling compliance with regulatory standards, and 
supporting trustworthy AI systems at scale. It can be integrated into existing deployment pipelines to provide a seamless safeguard for critical models across domains.
