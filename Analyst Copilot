Analyst Copilot — GenAI Assistant to “Talk to Your Data” in Natural Language

Summary:
In today’s data-driven workflows, analysts and business users often face delays due to dependence on technical teams for querying enterprise 
datasets or generating dashboards. This idea proposes a GenAI-powered assistant that enables users to interact with structured data using plain 
English — effectively "talking to their data".

By typing natural queries such as “Show me fraud transactions in the last 6 months by region”, users receive SQL-generated responses, visualizations, 
and business summaries in real time. The solution combines large language models (LLMs) with secure data connectors to ensure accurate and explainable results.

This approach enhances productivity, reduces the time spent on ad-hoc requests, and makes data access democratized across business functions — aligning 
with BoA’s goal of data empowerment and intelligent automation.
