Data Swarm — Smart Anomaly Detection Across Distributed Systems

Summary:
Modern systems generate massive volumes of logs, metrics, and transaction data across distributed microservices — making it difficult to detect 
rare yet critical failures in real time. Data Swarm is an intelligent anomaly detection engine that continuously scans across these silos using 
unsupervised machine learning and statistical models.

By identifying subtle deviations and surfacing alerts early, it helps prevent fraud attempts, system outages, and customer-impacting delays — enabling 
resilient, proactive system monitoring at scale.
